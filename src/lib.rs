#![no_std]

//! String formatting without memory allocator
//! ==========================================
//! 
//! In bare matal systems, there is often the task of converting numbers into text and formatting 
//! them. The standard Rust functions like format!, write! etc. cannot be used in no_std 
//! environments because they require a memory allocator. The arrform! macro uses the standard 
//! library functions, but writes to a fixed length array which is alocated on the stack.
//! 
//! This crate is usable in no_std environments. This is a replacement for the format! macro, based 
//! on a fixed-size array allocated on the stack.
//! 
//! # arrform!
//! 
//! ``` rust
//! use arrform::{arrform, ArrForm};
//! 
//! let af = arrform!(64, "write some stuff {}: {:.2}", "foo", 42.3456);
//! assert_eq!("write some stuff foo: 42.35", af.as_str());
//! ```
//! 
//! ## ArrForm struct as an alternative
//! 
//! The [ArrForm] struct provides more detailed error handling and supports multiple use of the 
//! same buffer. However, it is much more cumbersome to use and generates more syntactic noise. 
//! 
//! # Overhead
//! 
//! The convenient option to format can cost a lot of storage space. On a Cortex M4 992 bytes of 
//! program code are needed additionally, if instead of a simple string a simple u32 number is 
//! embedded with the help of the macro. It becomes even more expensive if f32 numbers are output 
//! formatted (30,928 bytes additional). The program code used to determine these numbers can be 
//! found in the example directory.
